\description{
Infants who required mechanical ventilation had tracheal aspirates samples collected at 7, 14, and 21 days of age (+/- 48 hours). Infants who were mechanically ventilated and had at least one tracheal aspirate collected were included in this study. Subjects were required to be enrolled within 7 days of age. Bacterial profiles were determined by broad-range amplification and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes.
