#' A data set containing the clinical data of the subjects sequenced for MRSA study
#'
#' Data from a study to define the nasal microbiome of hospital inpatients who are persistently colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared with matched, non-colonized controls. See original paper for matching proceedure.
